        problemStatement: "Khimji Jewellers, a brand deeply rooted in tradition, sought to create a 2025 calendar that went beyond the realm of functional design. Rather than just providing dates, the objective was to design a culturally immersive product that would reinforce their heritage positioning. The challenge was to develop a visual and emotional brand asset that could stand as a representation of Odisha's spirit, appeal to a modern audience, and serve as a collectible item for customers.",
        approach: "We approached the project as an opportunity to blend design with cultural narrative. Our research phase involved exploring traditional Odia festivals, folk art, and rituals to map out key cultural moments that could serve as anchor points across the calendar. Our design strategy was driven by a desire to create something deeply resonant—a visual product that could be proudly displayed and shared. Our focus was not just on aesthetic appeal but also on cultural integrity. We made conscious efforts to include bilingual content to connect emotionally with a wider demographic. The use of regional languages and styles meant the calendar wouldn't just hang on walls—it would become a talking point in homes and stores.",

Distributed across Khimji outlets, it earned a place in the homes and offices of loyal customers. It wasn't just appreciated—it was collected, shared, and talked about. The feedback highlighted how the calendar reminded customers of their roots. It also reinforced Khimji's image as not only a luxury jewellery brand but also a cultural custodian. It led to a noticeable increase in in-store engagement during the festive season. Customers often inquired about the artwork and shared photos online, organically boosting Khimji's social visibility and reach. The calendar achieved what it set out to do: build emotional equity for Khimji while adding value to customers' daily lives."
